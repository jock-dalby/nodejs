#npm

Whether you want to install a minimalist web framework, like express the popular bill system Gulp or any one of the over 150,000 free open source packages, you'll need npm. Npm is a package manager for JavaScript and it's most commonly used for installing packages for Node.js. Packages are way to bundle up and distribute software (in the case npm, it's JavaScript code) and may include other files too, for example images, HTML, CoffeeScript, TypeScript and CSS. Npm packages that you include in your Node.js projects are called modules. Some examples of Node.js modules are Express(the web framework) and Passport (the authentication framework). Npm can also install command line tools to help you with your application build process e.g. Grunt and Gulp.
